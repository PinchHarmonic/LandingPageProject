# LandingPageProject
Odin Project: Landing Page
Completed project today June 6 2023, started May 04 2023.
Learned a lot about using HTML, CSS as well as flexbox in order to make pages look great and feel more responsive. I am satisfied with how this made up buisinesses website looks and responds. I look forward to learning JavaScript next and incorperating it into future projects.
